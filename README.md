# ***Welcome!***

Hi all, my name is Jake Chouinard! I'm a Graduate Student at the University of Waterloo currently conducting research as a member of the Computational Neuroscience Research Group. I have also been a Teaching Assistant for a variety of courses---including Computational Neuroscience, Dynamics, and Linear Systems & Signals. I've previously worked as an Undergraduate Research Assistant with the Distributed Algorithms and Systems (DAS) Lab as well as the Vision and Image Processing (VIP) Lab here at the University of Waterloo. I have also worked as Software Development Intern for at MathWorks, Inc. I am currently looking for PhD opportunities, ideally focusing on theoretical and computational neuroscience.

My research interests lie in biologically-driven computational and theoretical modeling of cognitive phenomena. I am particularly interested in memory and its consolidation, as I see these processes as essential for all long-term learning and for the development of cognition as one transitions from baby to adult.

This GitHub serves to showcase some of the previous work I have done during my Master's as well as my Undergraduate program to improve my own understanding of software concepts as well as analytical and technical abilities.

## **Software-Based Persistent Memory Wear Leveling (c. 2023)**

This project was undertaken as part-time undergraduate research under the direction of Dr. Wojciech Golab. Throughout this work, I prototyped, tested, and debugged novel transactional algorthms in C++. The results of this work and additional are available in the conference proceedings of the [37th International Symposium on Distributed Computing](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/LIPIcs.DISC.2023.38).

## **Raceline Curvature Optimization (c. 2022)**

This project's inspiration comes from the [Mathworks EI Project 208](https://github.com/mathworks/MathWorks-Excellence-in-Innovation/tree/main/projects/Path%20Planning%20for%20Autonomous%20Race%20Cars) and uses a localized mathematical approach to optimizing the curvature of a raceline around a track. Extensive literature was reviewed to gain inspiration for how to approach this problem, and I settled on a localized approach due to its simplicity and effectiveness in implementation. The raceline is optimized iteratively until a certain threshold is met; at which point, the program begins to develop a velocity profile. This velocity profile is optimized for the curvature of the optimized raceline and is constrained by maximum tangential and centripetal forces. This output can be returned as a real-time video of the "car" going around the track as well as a plot PNG of the velocity profile colorized to indicate high speed and low speed regions.

## **Port Sorting Simulator (c. 2021)**
![Port Simulator](https://github.com/borealis31/The_Shipyard/blob/main/matlab/testCases/testCase1Output.PNG)

This project's inspiration comes from my interest in learning more about Object-Oriented Programming as well as Recursive Function design. This code contains three classes and three functions — one of which is a recursive merge sort function designed to sort objects of a certain class by different properties depending on the application. The code is well-documented and uses built-in MATLAB functions to identify errors in function and class implementation.

## **Statistical Text Analyzer (c. 2021)**
![Statistical Text Analyzer](https://github.com/borealis31/stats_analytics_school_project/blob/main/pride_and_prejudice_results.png)

The inspiration for this project comes from a Statistics course taken during my second year of university. I created a MATLAB script to analyze public domain text files hosted by Project Guttenberg and to find statistical characteristic values for word length. See [the code for this here](https://github.com/borealis31/Engineering-Statistics_Term-Project).
